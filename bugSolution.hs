The correct way to achieve the desired result is to use `zip` with the input list and a list of indices generated using `zip` with a list of indices generated from `[0..]` using `take` to ensure it's the same length as `xs`:

```haskell
myFunction :: [a] -> [(a, Int)]
myFunction xs = [(x, i) | (x, i) <- zip xs [0..(length xs - 1)]]
```

Alternatively, you can use `zipWith` to make this slightly more concise and efficient:

```haskell
myFunction :: [a] -> [(a, Int)]
myFunction xs = zipWith (
  x i -> (x, i)
) xs [0 .. length xs -1]
```
This version explicitly pairs each element with its corresponding index.  This avoids the truncation issue inherent in the original `zip` implementation.
