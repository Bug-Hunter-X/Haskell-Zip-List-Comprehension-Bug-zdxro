# Haskell Zip List Comprehension Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error when using list comprehensions with `zip` in Haskell.  The code attempts to create a list of tuples, each containing an element and its index, but incorrectly handles cases where the input list is longer than the index sequence generated by `[0..]`, resulting in an incomplete list. The solution shows how to correctly handle this to get expected results for all input list lengths.
