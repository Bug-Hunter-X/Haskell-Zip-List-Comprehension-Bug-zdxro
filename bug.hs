This Haskell code attempts to use a list comprehension to create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an element from a list and its index.  However, it uses `zip` incorrectly, resulting in an incomplete list if the list has more than one element. 

```haskell
myFunction :: [a] -> [(a, Int)]
myFunction xs = [(x, i) | (x, i) <- zip xs [0..]]
```

The issue lies in that `zip` stops when the shorter of the two lists is exhausted. If `xs` is longer than the integers generated by `[0..]`, then you'll lose elements.
